Learning how to integrate PyCharm IDE and Git/GitHub

# Notes
- This is now being editted in PyCharm IDE.

# Procedure
1. Clone a Remote Repository to Local Machine.
```git clone <some-https.git>```
2. Go to the Cloned Repository and Create a Virtual Environment.
```python -m venv venv```
3. Go to the Virtual Environment Scripts Folder and activate using `source` command if in git-bash: `source activate`. 
* To deactivate, go the the Scripts folder in venv, and just run `deactivate`, without the source command.
4. Open the folder as a Project in an IDE such as PyCharm.
* Now you can use Git in PyCharm Console or GUI.

Note that the procedure would be more or less similar with other IDEs such as VSCode.
